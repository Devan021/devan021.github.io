I m a fresher at Amrita University , I am a CSE2021-24 stream  student ,Here in this blog i want to describe about my experience when i applied for amfoss(which is a prestigiou club in Amrita )
 
# My Experience
  
  *At first when i got the lists of task i had to do inorder to get into amfoss i was shocked ,Those tasks were something i had never seen in my life they seemed extremly hard since 
  since i didnt anything about programming (Its not that now i know a lot about programming but i know i have definetly improved from my past self) , To be honest i wasnt able to do most of the tasks,
  I was a biomath student so i had to learn everything from the bottom up, i watched lots of tutorials on youtube asked helped from my seniors(Well most of them asked me to search google - I felt annoyed at first but finally realised, Thats how college life works u wont get spoonfeeded like in school anymore),
  i finally started surfing the web for infos about each task  it was hard for me at first and i failed to get the expected results from google as i am newbie in such things but nowadays it feels a lot more easier to me
  ,Now coming to the Amfoss tasks , Some of them were way out of my league to be honest .. i tried doing them night after night while refering to tons of tutorials(eg: The aeglo mars task)
  That task was easier for my friend but was tough for me i could have asked my friend to guide  but i didnt wanna get spoon feeded again so i decided to take help from my friend google, 
  Eventhough i couldnt complete the task i was atleast able to understand some concepts like how location-coordinates work on google maps etc.. i feel no regret now,The tasks all were tough to me but i was able to do a couple of them
  and i feel extremly satisfied the past me couldnt have even done that..The Experience i got from doing those tasks are flourishing and even if i dont get selected to amfoss(Obviously due to the less no of tasks i have done)
  I ll keep trying and continue to do so until i get a place in amfoss*
